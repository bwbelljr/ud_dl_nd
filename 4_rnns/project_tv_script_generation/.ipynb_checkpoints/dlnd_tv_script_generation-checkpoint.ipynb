The latter is better for sentences that we want to predict because it better matches the average length of a sentence in Seinfeld. `hidden_dim=500` while `n_layers=2`, as suggested in lessons (values of 2 or 3). Learning rate is 0.0008, after experimenting with rates in the range (0.001, 0.01). When the learning rate was < 0.005, the loss would reduce but not reliably. For larger learning rates, the loss would reduce and then increase. Ultimately, the biggest difference I found in training was not due to hyperparameters but the architecture itself; removing a dropout layer after the lstm layer (which already has dropout).\r\n",
