       "'I can\\'t say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers. Yes, it\\'s bogged down by an overly-padded running time, hamfisted editing, and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects. And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch. <br /><br />On the other hand, it\\'s also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant as the \"core\" team, and Garofalo and Studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team. I can\\'t say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine. <br /><br />The plot, as I said above, is your classic \"underdog-makes-good\" stuff. No surprises there, since you know they\\'re going to triumph. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. Underneath it all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. Look at Azaria\\'s relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy\\'s endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing\\'s secret identity; Stiller\\'s rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who\\'d always go into quivering, impotent rages on the playground); Garofalo\\'s desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true appeal of super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, \"Mystery Men\" shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many.<br /><br />It never really gels into a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that. The fact that it\\'s supposed to be good, nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here, so I\\'ll issue a caveat: if you\\'re the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical (\"Am I to believe this is some sort of.. *snort*... _magic_ xylophone?\"), then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film. Go rent a Sandler film instead.<br /><br />(7/10)'"

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples. An example of this in industry might be peforming an end of month report. This method of inference can also be useful to us as it means to can perform inference on our entire test set. \n",
