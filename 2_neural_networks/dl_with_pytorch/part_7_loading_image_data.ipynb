Instead, yo will likely be dealing with full-sized images like you would get from smart phone cameras. In this notebook, we will look at how to load images and use them to train neural networks.\n","\n","We will be using a [dataset of cat and dog photos](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) available from Kaggle.

In general you will use `ImageFolder` like so:\n","\n","```python\n","dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data/', transform=transform)\n","```\n","\n","where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a list of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n","```\n","root/dog/xxx.png\n","root/dog/xxy.png\n","root/dog/xxz.png\n","\n","root/cat/123.png\n","root/cat/nsdf3.png\n","root/cat/asd932_.png\n","```\n","\n","where each class has its own directory (`cat` and `dog`) for the images. The images are then labeled with the class taken from the directory name. So here, the image `123.png` would be loaded with the class label `cat`. You can download the dataset already structured like this [from here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip). This is already split into a training set and test set.\n","\n","### Transforms\n","\n","#### [fill in here...]\n","\n","### Data Loaders\n","\n","With the `ImageFolder` loaded, you have to pass it to a [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). The `DataLoader` takes a dataset (such as you would get from `ImageFolder`) and returns batches of images and the corresponding labels. You can set various parameters like the batch size and if the data is shuffled after each epoch.\n","\n","```python\n","dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\n","```\n","\n","Here `dataloader` is a [generator](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/). To get data out of it, you need to loop through it or convert it to an iterator and call `next()`.\n","\n","```python\n","# Looping through it, get one batch on each loop\n","for images, labels in dataloader:\n","  pass\n","\n","# Get one batch\n","images, labels = next(iter(dataloader))\n","```\n","\n",">**Exercise:** Load images from the `Cat_Dog_data/train` folder, define a few transforms, then build the dataloader."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ojJOX7s8vo4v","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606431052945,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":906,"user":{"displayName":"Bob Bell","photoUrl":"","userId":"12813757050463534657"}}},"source":["# Uncomment these lines to download and unzip files as  directory\n","#!wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip\n","#!unzip Cat_Dog_data.zip"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wuYNlRwYuKWa"},"source":["data_dir = 'Cat_Dog_data/train'"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
