PyTOrch in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from NumPy. These NumPy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with Python and the NumPy/Scipy stack compared to TensorFlow and other frameworks.\n","\n","## Neural Networks\n","\n","Deep Learning is based on artificial neural networks which have been around in some form since the late 1950s. The networks are built from individual parts approximating neurons, typically called units or simply \"neurons.\" Each unit has some number of weighted inputs. These weighted inputs are summed together (a linear combination) then passed through an activation functions to get the unit's output.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/raw/master/intro-to-pytorch/assets/simple_neuron.png\" width=400px>\n","\n","Mathematically, this looks like: \n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","y &= f(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b) \\\\\n","y &= f\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i +b \\right)\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","With vectors this is the dot/inner production of two vectors:\n","\n","$$\n","h = \\begin{bmatrix}\n","x_1 \\, x_2 \\cdots x_n\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","\\cdot\n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","            w_1 \\\\\n","            w_2 \\\\\n","            \\vdots \\\\\n","            w_n\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","$$\n","\n","## Tensors\n","\n","It turns out neural network computations are just a bunch of linear algebra operations on *tensors*, a generalization of matrices. A vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, an array with 3 indices is a 3-dimensinoal tensor (RGB color images for example). The fundamental data structure for neural networks are tensors and PyTorch (as well as pretty much every other deep learning framework) is built around tensors.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/raw/master/intro-to-pytorch/assets/tensor_examples.svg\" width=600px>\n","\n","With the basics covered, it's time to explore how we can use PyTorch to build a simple neural network."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rdXL0cBUd7kO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605639234758,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3165,"user":{"displayName":"Bob Bell","photoUrl":"","userId":"12813757050463534657"}}},"source":["# First, import PyTorch\n","import torch"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"jeabqyTHjlfz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605639280999,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":384,"user":{"displayName":"Bob Bell","photoUrl":"","userId":"12813757050463534657"}}},"source":["def activation(x):\n","  \"\"\" Sigmoid activation function\n","\n","      Arguments\n","      ---------\n","      x: torch.Tensor\n","  \"\"\"\n","  return 1/(1+torch.exp(-x))"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Dmt-x4Rqjxeo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605639411294,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":491,"user":{"displayName":"Bob Bell","photoUrl":"","userId":"12813757050463534657"}}},"source":["### Generate some data\n","torch.manual_seed(7) # Set the random seed so things are predictable\n","\n","# Features are random normal variables\n","features = torch.randn((1,5))\n","\n","# True weights for our data, random normal variables again\n","weights = torch.randn_like(features)\n","\n","# And a true bias term\n","bias = torch.randn((1,1))"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cnNK3rCbkRQR"},"source":["Above I generated data we can use to get the output of our simple network.
